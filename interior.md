Interior smelled like there was some inter-species territory marking. Dont know what it was, but it was bad.  
Told my wife and asked her for advice. She said "sounds like urine trouble" and promptly left. She has tried to apologize, but I need more time.    

Tore everything out, washed with copious amounts of chemicals.  
Cleaned up floor welds inside.  
Replaced seats with some fabric seats from a wrecked late model mustang. 
Got a handbrake assembly from a foxbody mustang and trashed the oldschool under-dash e-brake. 
New carpet and insulation.  
Got rid of rear seats and used some corregated board as a divider.  
The headliner got torn up as I was cleaning it, so replaced that with a diy job using styrofoam insulation, corregated plastic board and curtain fabric.
I'd like to renew the gauge cluster and dash, but that'll need to wait till I decide on engine upgrade/replacement.  

Pics coming thoon.
